          Mixing Spaceflight And Philanthropy There is no escaping the fact
          that a flight to space (at least to low-Earth orbit), with prices in
          the tens of millions of dollars, is for the ultra-wealthy. There is
          an increasing trend of wealthy individuals mixing their spaceflight
          dreams with philanthropy. While some of these examples may extend
          beyond what is traditionally...

          A Look Back Let's start by saying that nothing worthwhile comes
          easy. We're celebrating the 20th anniversary of Dennis Tito's
          spaceflight. He made history by becoming the first fare-paying
          private citizen to launch to space. But the road that he traveled to
          get there was full of challenges. Cast your mind back 20 years ago
          to April 2001...

          Commercial Spaceflight in 2021 In early 2019 I wrote what is still
          one of the most popular blogs on Space Adventures' website -
          Commercial Spaceflight in 2019. I thought it would be interesting to
          re-visit this topic and look at the status of commercial spaceflight
          at the start of 2021. As is often the case in the space industry

          I think many of us will be glad to see the end of 2020 and will
          welcome 2021 with open arms. But before we do, I thought it was
          worth looking back at some of 2020's significant achievements in the
          field of space exploration - completed despite the global pandemic -
          as well as some of our favorite photographs

          A Day in the Life of a Private Astronaut (Part 2) We are often asked
          what there is to do on the International Space Station (ISS) – while
          the view is phenomenal (and the pictures don’t lie!) surely visitors
          don’t just spend all day looking out of the window. So in this

          A Day in the Life of a Private Astronaut (Part 1) A small group of
          lucky (and very successful) people have launched to the
          International Space Station (ISS) on flights arranged by Space
          Adventures. In the coming years Space Adventures has opportunities
          to fly to the ISS on both the Russian Soyuz and the Boeing

          It’s the next step in humanity’s expansion beyond Earth For almost
          20 years, Space Adventures has created unique and previously

          As you may know, we’ve arranged eight spaceflight missions to the
          International Space Station (ISS) with our clients traveling over 36
          million miles. Along the way, we’ve also arranged several “firsts”
