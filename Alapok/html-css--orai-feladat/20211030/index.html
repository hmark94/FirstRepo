      <p>
        Mixing Spaceflight And Philanthropy There is no escaping the fact that a
        flight to space (at least to low-Earth orbit), with prices in the tens
        of millions of dollars, is for the ultra-wealthy. There is an increasing
        trend of wealthy individuals mixing their spaceflight dreams with
        philanthropy. While some of these examples may extend beyond what is
        traditionally...

      <p>
        A Look Back Let's start by saying that nothing worthwhile comes easy.
        We're celebrating the 20th anniversary of Dennis Tito's spaceflight. He
        made history by becoming the first fare-paying private citizen to launch
        to space. But the road that he traveled to get there was full of
        challenges. Cast your mind back 20 years ago to April 2001...

        Commercial Spaceflight in 2021 In early 2019 I wrote what is still one
        of the most popular blogs on Space Adventures' website - Commercial
        Spaceflight in 2019. I thought it would be interesting to re-visit this
        topic and look at the status of commercial spaceflight at the start of
        2021. As is often the case in the space industry

        I think many of us will be glad to see the end of 2020 and will welcome
        2021 with open arms. But before we do, I thought it was worth looking
        back at some of 2020's significant achievements in the field of space
        exploration - completed despite the global pandemic - as well as some of
        our favorite photographs

        A Day in the Life of a Private Astronaut (Part 2) We are often asked
        what there is to do on the International Space Station (ISS) – while the
        view is phenomenal (and the pictures don’t lie!) surely visitors don’t
        just spend all day looking out of the window. So in this two-part blog

        A Day in the Life of a Private Astronaut (Part 1) A small group of lucky
        (and very successful) people have launched to the International Space
        Station (ISS) on flights arranged by Space Adventures. In the coming
        years Space Adventures has opportunities to fly to the ISS on both the
        Russian Soyuz and the Boeing Starliner. We are often

        It’s the next step in humanity’s expansion beyond Earth For almost 20
        years, Space Adventures has created unique and previously impossible
        opportunities for private citizens to experience space. As you may know,
        we’ve arranged eight spaceflight missions to the International Space
        Station (ISS) with our clients traveling over 36 million miles. Along
        the way, we’ve also arranged several “firsts”
