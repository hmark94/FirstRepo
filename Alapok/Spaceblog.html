        </p>
        <p>A Look Back Let's start by saying that nothing worthwhile comes easy. We're celebrating the 20th anniversary
            of
            Dennis Tito's spaceflight. He made history by becoming the first fare-paying private citizen to launch to
            space.
            But the road that he traveled to get there was full of challenges. Cast your mind back 20 years ago to April
            2001...</p>

        <p>Commercial Spaceflight in 2021 In early 2019 I wrote what is still one of the most popular blogs on Space
            Adventures' website - Commercial Spaceflight in 2019. I thought it would be interesting to re-visit this
            topic
            and look at the status of commercial spaceflight at the start of 2021. As is often the case in the space
            industry</p>

        </p>
        <p>I think many of us will be glad to see the end of 2020 and will welcome 2021 with open arms. But before we
            do, I
            thought it was worth looking back at some of 2020's significant achievements in the field of space
            exploration -
            completed despite the global pandemic - as well as some of our favorite photographs</p>

        <p>A Day in the Life of a Private Astronaut (Part 2) We are often asked what there is to do on the International
            Space Station (ISS) – while the view is phenomenal (and the pictures don’t lie!) surely visitors don’t just
            spend all day looking out of the window. So in this two-part blog post we aim to provide</p>

        </p>
        <p>A Day in the Life of a Private Astronaut (Part 1) A small group of lucky (and very successful) people have
            launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on flights arranged by Space Adventures. In the coming
            years
            Space Adventures has opportunities to fly to the ISS on both the Russian Soyuz and the Boeing Starliner. We
            are
            often</p>

        <p>It’s the next step in humanity’s expansion beyond Earth For almost 20 years, Space Adventures has created
            unique
            and previously impossible opportunities for private citizens to experience space. As you may know, we’ve
            arranged eight spaceflight missions to the International Space Station (ISS) with our clients traveling over
            36
            million miles. Along the way, we’ve also arranged several “firsts”</p>
